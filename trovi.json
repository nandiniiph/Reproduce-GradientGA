      "description": "## Overview\n\nThis artifact reproduces the main experiments from the paper **Gradient-Guided Genetic Algorithms for Sample-Efficient Molecular Optimization**.\n\nWe reimplemented and executed the molecular optimization pipelines to evaluate Gradient-GA and multiple baseline methods under a fixed oracle-call budget.\n\n**Includes:**\n- **Reproduced Code:** Full codebase used to run Gradient-GA and baseline methods.\n- **Experimental Results:** Raw outputs and aggregated statistics from our runs.\n- **Analysis Scripts:** Scripts to compute AUC Top-1, Top-10, Top-100 and generate plots, heatmaps, and tables.\n- **Original Paper:** Gradient-Guided Genetic Algorithms for Sample-Efficient Molecular Optimization.\n\n## Reproduction Goal\n\nValidate the main claim of the paper that **incorporating gradient information accelerates convergence** in molecular optimization under a strict oracle-call budget.\n\n## Key Findings (From our experiments)\n\nOur reproduced experiments show that **Gradient-GA consistently achieves higher AUC Top-10 and Top-100 scores** with fewer oracle calls on the Mestranol Similarity objective compared to baseline genetic algorithms. Gradient-GA also maintains better diversity and synthetic accessibility, confirming the robustness and efficiency of gradient-guided optimization.\n\n## Environment and Notes\n\n- Python 3.9+\n- PyTorch, NumPy, RDKit, TDC\n- Fixed random seeds\n- Minor modifications for reproducibility and consistent logging\n",
